    description: "The Lexus GX 470 was introduced as the first generation of Lexus's mid-size luxury SUV, positioned between the car-based RX and the full-size LX in the brand's lineup. Based on the Toyota Land Cruiser Prado platform, it featured body-on-frame construction with genuine off-road capability combined with Lexus luxury. Powered by a 4.7-liter V8 engine initially producing 235 horsepower and 320 lb-ft of torque (later increased to 263 horsepower and 323 lb-ft in 2005 with the addition of VVT-i technology), paired with a five-speed automatic transmission. The standard full-time four-wheel drive system included a center locking Torsen differential and a dual-range transfer case with low-range gearing. The suspension system featured front independent double-wishbone design and a rear four-link solid axle with air springs and adaptive variable suspension (AVS) that could adjust to different terrain conditions. Advanced off-road technology included Downhill Assist Control, Hill-start Assist Control, and adjustable height control allowing the driver to raise the vehicle for additional ground clearance. The interior offered luxurious appointments with three rows of seating for up to eight passengers, trimmed with leather and bird's-eye maple wood accents. Premium features included a Mark Levinson audio system, DVD-based navigation, and rear seat entertainment options. A Sport package was added in 2004 with special wheels and a roof rack, while a Kinetic Dynamic Suspension System (KDSS) became available in 2005, improving both on-road handling and off-road articulation. A refresh in 2008 brought revised exterior styling and interior enhancements. The GX 470 successfully established the model's reputation for blending traditional SUV capability with Lexus luxury and reliability, appealing to buyers seeking refinement without sacrificing utility and off-road performance."
